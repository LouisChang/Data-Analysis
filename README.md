# Data-Analysis
This is from CSCI 626 Data analysis and simulation class at William & Mary.

It is a very serious class, analysis based on Amazon AWS is needed. High computing knowledge is required for this class compared with other classes.

In different HW, we use different random number generator to get our M/M/1 or M/M/1/2 simulation model. All related information can be found in the author of the textbook Larry Leemis, his personal website is http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/. Just download the code below Discrete Event Simulation: A First Course.
